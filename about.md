<h1>Bio</h1>
<p>I'm in my second year of a PhD in Economics at UT Austin. I have degrees in Computer Science and Statistics from the University of Arizona. My research interests are in Development, Industrial Organization, and Econometrics. I like programming in R, Julia, and occasionally Python.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in Austin, Texas and have an abiding love for my fair city that has become so popular. I enjoy music, biking, and cooking in my free time. You can reach me by email at <a href="mailto:nhattersley@utexas.edu">nhattersley@utexas.edu</a>. You can read my CV <a href="cv">here</a></p>
