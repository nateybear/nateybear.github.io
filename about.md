<h1>Bio</h1>
<p>I'm in my fourth year of a PhD in Economics at UT Austin. I have degrees in Computer Science and Statistics from the University of Arizona. My research interests are in Industrial Organizationâ€”current work centers on market concentration in franchise car dealerships, as well as collusion via algorithmic pricing.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in Austin, and I like to cook, go for walks, and write code in my free time.</p>
